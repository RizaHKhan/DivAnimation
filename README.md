# DivAnimation
Animating HTML elements using Javascript

WHAT I LEARNT:
1. Animiating HTML elements using JS
2. Click events
3. setInterval functions to help animate

WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED
1. Simple app to practice animations, nothing specific besides maybe more dynamic movements. 
2. More elegant movements
